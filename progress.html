        <p> The legend of Henry Potter and the curse of the mints
        A long, long, time ago, in a galaxy far far away, Henry ate one too many mints. For the rest of his life, he had to eat mints- many,many, mints. It got so bad that one day he had to eat a mint every mint. He lived a long, sad life with the curse of the mints. His peers questioned his sanity; as it is hard to have a conversation with the other person eating a mint each minute.</p>
